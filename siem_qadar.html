            <h3>What is the IBM QRadar?</h3>
            <p>The IBM QRadar is a security information and event management or SIEM product that is designed for enterprises. The tool collects data from the organization and the network devices. It also connects to the operating systems, host assets, applications, vulnerabilities, user activities, and behaviors. IBM QRadar is used to perform analysis of the log data and the network flows in real-time so that malicious activities can be identified and stopped as soon as possible. Thus, the main aim of the IBM QRadar is to prevent or minimize the damage to its host organization.</p>
            <p>The following are some of the reasons that lead to the most common problems faced by organizations in terms of security:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lack of actionable real-time security intelligence indicators</li>
                <li>Minimal endpoint visibility</li>
                <li>No security or poor AI integration</li>
                <li>No detection of anomalous or abnormal activity</li>
                <li>Too many tools and poor integration</li>
                <li>The volume of logs that produce noise</li>
                <li>Automation with poor or no defense</li>
                <li>Higher cost for maintaining and managing security</li>
                <li>Lack of resources and proper skills</li>
                <li>An inability to enforce the compliance policies efficiently</li>
            </ul>    
                <p>The IBM QRadar SIEM uses a real-time integrated Cybersecurity AI, machine learning, and behavior analytics to prevent the attacks in the blink of an eye and with a very less cost compared to what human supervision can ensure. QRadar can address the bulk security issues that the companies face and save a lot of money. The security teams that struggle with patching endpoints properly and updating them can get their problems solved with IBM BigFix that has QRadar SIEM integrated into it. Most of the common issues are solved with this.</p>
                <p>Deployment of the IBM QRadar SIEM is possible in the form of software, hardware, or a product meant for virtual application. Event processors for the collection, storage, and analysis of event collectors and event data make up the architecture of the product. They help to capture and forward the data.</p>
                <p>There are flow processors as well that collect the network flows of Layer 4 of the OSI model. The Layer 7 application traffic gets a deep packet inspection through the QFlow processors. Management of SIEM can be performed by the SOC or Security Operations Center through centralized consoles. The flow processors are similar to the event processors, however, these are meant for network flows. The consoles offer a lot of help to the people who are managing or using the SIEM.</p>
                <h4>Evolution of IBM QRadar</h4>
                <p>According to IBM, the QRadar Security Information and Event Management is an essential tool that would aid the security teams in prioritizing the threats across the enterprise and detecting them accurately. The tool offers the necessary intelligent insights that would help the teams to respond as quickly as possible and reduce the impact of the incidents. Network flow data and log events from thousands of endpoints, devices, and applications over the network are consolidated.</p>
                <p>QRadar then correlates all the different information and these related events are compiled to produce single alerts so that remediation and incident analysis can be accelerated. QRadar and SIEM are available in on-premises and cloud environments.</p>
